# Technical-Document-Analysis
We are looking for someone who:
- has studied electrical engineering or computer science for at least four years and is about to graduate or has graduated in the last three years
- is very smart and has grades at university that put him or her at the top 10% of the class
- has a good command of written English
- is willing to spend at least 20 hours per week on a challenging task that involves reading of technical documents and writing down their thoughts

Your task would be:
- study documents that describe technical devices (e.g.  computers or mobile devices using machine learning, computer programs in general, electrical circuits, ....)
- compare a patent document with some prior art documents and write a summary on whether you think that some of the aspects in the patent are new compared to the prior art documents.  I would explain the task in more detail. You do not need prior knowledge of law or patents - important is that you are able to understand the technology in the documents and that you are able to express your thoughts in English

What we offer:
- you get to work on cutting edge technologies
- continuous feedback on your work, which typically leads to a continuously increasing hourly rate (as you gain more experience)
- a long-term work relationship. If the work goes well and if you are interested, you can come to Munich (Germany) and continue your work here.
------
technical document analysis task, which involves studying, comparing, and writing summaries of patents and prior art documents. While the task involves reading and understanding highly technical content and expressing your thoughts clearly in English, it can be supported with Python tools to automate and streamline parts of the process.

Although the majority of the task described requires human interpretation and expertise, I can suggest a Python-based approach to assist with the technical reading and summarization process.

Here’s a possible Python-based workflow to help you with this task:
Python Workflow for Technical Document Analysis

    Reading and Extracting Text from Documents:
        Extract the content from PDF documents (patents, prior art documents, etc.) using Python libraries like PyMuPDF or pdfplumber.

    Natural Language Processing (NLP):
        Use NLP techniques to compare and summarize sections of the documents.
        Key functions: Text comparison, summary generation, keyword extraction.

    Document Comparison:
        Use techniques such as cosine similarity or other vector-based approaches (using TF-IDF or pre-trained models like BERT) to compare documents and identify new or unique aspects.

    Summarization and Feedback:
        After comparing documents, generate summaries with the help of AI tools such as transformers (using models like GPT or T5) to automatically generate summaries for each document.

    Tracking and Reporting:
        Organize the analysis process and document your thought process by saving your results to a structured format (e.g., Excel, CSV, or Markdown for easy integration into reports).

Here’s a step-by-step implementation guide with Python code:
Step 1: Extract Text from PDF Documents

You’ll need to extract text from the PDF documents (patent and prior art) to analyze the content. PyMuPDF (also known as fitz) is a good choice.

First, install the required libraries:

pip install pymupdf
pip install transformers
pip install nltk

Step 2: Extract Text from a PDF

import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page in doc:
        text += page.get_text()
    return text

# Example usage:
pdf_path = 'your_document.pdf'
text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path)
print(text[:500])  # Display the first 500 characters

Step 3: Summarizing the Document Using NLP (using Hugging Face Transformers)

We can use the transformers library for text summarization.

from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained summarization model
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")

def summarize_text(text):
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=200, min_length=50, do_sample=False)
    return summary[0]['summary_text']

# Example usage:
summary = summarize_text(text)
print(summary)

Step 4: Document Comparison (Text Similarity)

We can use TF-IDF or BERT embeddings for comparing the two documents (patent vs prior art).

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def compare_documents(text1, text2):
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
    tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform([text1, text2])
    cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0:1], tfidf_matrix[1:2])
    return cosine_sim[0][0]

# Example usage:
prior_art_text = extract_text_from_pdf('prior_art_document.pdf')
similarity_score = compare_documents(text, prior_art_text)
print(f"Cosine Similarity: {similarity_score}")

Step 5: Organizing Your Thoughts

You can use Python to format your thoughts and save them in a structured report format (e.g., CSV, Markdown, or JSON).

import csv

def save_summary_to_csv(summary, similarity_score, filename="report.csv"):
    with open(filename, mode='w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)
        writer.writerow(['Summary', 'Similarity Score'])
        writer.writerow([summary, similarity_score])

# Example usage:
save_summary_to_csv(summary, similarity_score)

Step 6: Generating Reports (Optional)

You can use Markdown or a Python-based document generator to prepare a report of your analysis.

def generate_markdown_report(summary, similarity_score, filename="report.md"):
    with open(filename, 'w') as file:
        file.write(f"# Document Analysis Report\n\n")
        file.write(f"## Summary\n{summary}\n\n")
        file.write(f"## Similarity Score: {similarity_score}\n")

# Example usage:
generate_markdown_report(summary, similarity_score)

Summary of What This Workflow Achieves:

    Text Extraction: Automatically extract content from patent documents and prior art PDFs.
    NLP Summarization: Summarize long technical documents to capture key points.
    Document Comparison: Compare the patent document with prior art to assess novelty using cosine similarity or vector-based approaches.
    Documentation: Store your results in structured reports (CSV, Markdown) for future reference or submission.

Additional Recommendations:

    Deep Learning Models: If you need more advanced semantic understanding or summarization, consider using pre-trained transformer models (e.g., GPT-3, T5, BERT).
    Visualization: If you want to present results visually (e.g., showing document comparison), you could use libraries like matplotlib or seaborn.
    Custom Trained Models: Depending on your needs, you might want to fine-tune a model specifically on patent documents for more accurate results.

Conclusion

While the task requires deep understanding and critical thinking, Python can assist with repetitive tasks like extracting data, comparing documents, and generating summaries. Using tools like Hugging Face for summarization and sklearn for document comparison can help you automate parts of the process, leaving you to focus on high-level analysis.
